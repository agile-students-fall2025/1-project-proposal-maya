## Project title

Kitchen Helper

## What and why?

I want to build a system to detect food in images. It can be used to suggest recipes that use that ingredient or give nutrition information about it. I know a lot of people struggle to cook at home or eat healthier because they don't know what to make and they aren't aware of what they are eating. It also can help people use the ingredients they already have at home so they can save money and reduce waste. 

## For whom?

I think there are a lot of people like me that could benefit from something like this. My roommate and I always say we want to cook more and eat healthier, but it is so difficult to know where to start. Many people are in the same boat and can benefit from an application like this.

## How?

The user will take a photo of food that they have and then they will see a screen that shows the nutritional information about it and recipe suggestions.

## Scope

Although the front end of the project can be reduced to a few pages, the backend is definitely enough of a challenge, but doable. An image classification model would need to be trained to classify enough types of food to be able to have the application work well. The model would then have to be used in image classification software. In addition, we would also have to connect to databases or some other resource to get the nutrition information about all the foods. And, finally, we would also have to create a database of recipes that contain each of the different food types. Of course there is also the need to create and connect everything to the front end.
